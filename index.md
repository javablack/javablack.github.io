# Olawale Ajayi – Copywriter & Content Strategist
<p align="center">

</p>

I am a storyteller-for-hire with **8+ years of experience** helping brands in finance, real estate, technology, SaaS, medicine, and beauty craft content that people actually want to read. The kind that sells, teaches, and builds trust, without the soul-crushing corporate fluff that makes readers glaze over faster than a Krispy Kreme donut.  

Over the years, my words have done more than fill pages. They have generated **over $900,000 in combined client acquisitions, increased sales, and marketing savings**, while I personally earned over **$70,000+ on Upwork** delivering high-performance copy. My email campaigns have achieved **open rates north of 60%**; well above industry averages, because I write subject lines that get clicks, not yawns.  

From **compliance-friendly fintech scripts** for Trading.com (yes, I make finance sound exciting without breaking a single SEC rule) to **high-performing real estate blogs** for Builder Homesite Inc., I have helped businesses worldwide connect with their audiences in ways that are clear, compelling, and impossible to ignore.  

**My mission?** To make your brand voice so sharp and distinctive that your competitors will “accidentally” start copying it, and then wonder why it still does not work for them.  

**My secret?** Every piece I create is built on deep research, tailored strategy, and just the right dose of personality - so your audience feels like you are speaking *only* to them.

## 🚀 What I Bring to the Table

- **Proven Expertise:** 8+ years of writing, editing, and strategy for clients from startups to global brands. I have delivered content that drives clicks, boosts trust, and sometimes even gets bookmarked (yes, that still happens).  
- **Versatility:** Blogs, landing pages, ad scripts, video content, and more - all tailored to your industry and audience so it feels custom-built, not copy-pasted.  
- **Strategy + Execution:** I do not just write pretty words. I research, plan, and optimize so that every sentence works as hard as you do.  
- **B2B & B2C Friendly:** I can speak to business leaders, everyday consumers, or both - without sounding like I am wearing a stiff suit or selling snake oil.
